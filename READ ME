This command line script is intented to assist with generating Assimil8or presets. Learn more about the Assimil8or http://www.rossum-electro.com/products/assimil8or/

Currently, this script is very crude and quite limited. It will generate a preset referencing the first 8 samples in a folder.

To give it a try:

First, make a copy the folder containing samples that you wish to create Assimil8r presets for. 

Second, move the copied samples folders into "SampleFolder".

Third, open a terminal on your computer.

Fourth, in the terminal change directories to SampleFolder: cd SampleFolder

Fifth, run the presetgener8r script: sh presetgener8r.sh

Sixth, you should now see that each of the folders inside "SampleFolder" have Assimil8r presets in them.

Seventh, you can now copy your sample folders to the root of your microSD card and load each directory in your Assimil8r.
